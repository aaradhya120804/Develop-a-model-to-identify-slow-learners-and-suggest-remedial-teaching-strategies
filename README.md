# Develop-a-model-to-identify-slow-learners-and-suggest-remedial-teaching-strategies
This project addresses the critical
challenge of identifying students who may require additional academic support
("slow learners") within educational settings. Early identification
allows educators to implement timely and targeted interventions, fostering
improved learning outcomes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, this
project develops a predictive system using readily available student data,
including standardized test scores, average grades, attendance percentages,
frequency of lateness, and class participation ratings.

A key focus was addressing the common issue of class imbalance inherent in such datasets, which was effectively
managed using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) on the
training data. Several classification algorithms – including Logistic
Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and
Random Forest – were trained and rigorously evaluated using metrics appropriate
for imbalanced data, such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC AUC. The
Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance, achieving high precision
and recall, indicating its effectiveness in accurately identifying students
needing support while minimizing false classifications.

Beyond simple prediction, the system
provides the probability associated with its prediction and generates specific,
actionable remedial teaching suggestions. These suggestions are based not only
on the prediction itself but are also tailored using the student's input data
points, offering practical guidance for educators. The final implementation
includes an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit, providing an accessible
and user-friendly interface for educators to input student data and receive instant
predictions and recommendations.

This work delivers a practical tool to
aid educators in making data-informed decisions for personalized student
support, thereby contributing to the enhancement of the teaching-learning
process and the overall quality of education.
